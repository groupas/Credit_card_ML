# Credit_card_ML
The "Credit_card_ML" repository is a comprehensive collection of machine learning techniques and models specifically designed to detect and prevent credit card fraud.


In the context of credit card fraud, the goal of this research is to provide a machine learning-based system to predict fraudulent transactions.
The project intends to improve the precision and effectiveness of fraud detection systems in the financial industry by utilizing various machine learning approaches.


USAGE

1) Prepare the dataset:
Import the repsrective database. For this reposiotory the dataset utilized, was first made available at Kaggle,
community of data scientists and machine learners, as well as being used for a research effort by the ULB Machine Learning Group.

2) TrainÂ the model: 
Run the training script to use the dataset to train the machine learning model. 
Numerous techniques are available, including logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting. 
As necessary, alter the setups and hyperparameters.

3)Make predictions:
Once the model has been trained, you may use it to forecast future credit card transactions that haven't yet occurred. 
Get a fraud probability score by feeding the model the pertinent transactional details.

4)Review the model: Utilize suitable assessment metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC-ROC, to rate the model's performance. 
Verify the model's capability to spot fraudulent transactions.
